## ðŸ§­ Wireframes

Before development, I created **wireframes** to outline the structure and layout of the website.  
This helped plan where each element (navigation, content sections, images, and footer) would be placed and ensured a cohesive flow across the page.

- The wireframes guided the **visual hierarchy**, ensuring the design remained user-friendly and intuitive.
- Accessibility and readability were considered from the start, aligning with UX best practices.

## ðŸ¤– Use of GitHub Copilot and AI Tools

AI tools â€” particularly **GitHub Copilot** and **ChatGPT** â€” were used strategically throughout the development process to improve workflow and branding consistency.

### **Branding & Logo Creation**
- Copilot provided helpful code suggestions for structuring the siteâ€™s **branding section** and integrating a **custom logo**.
- It assisted in refining the placement and alignment of the logo within the navigation bar, maintaining accessibility and visual balance.

### **Code Corrections & Readability**
- AI tools suggested **cleaner code syntax**, helping to correct small errors that affected functionality.
- It also improved **readability and consistency**, ensuring the HTML and CSS followed semantic and accessible coding standards.
- This made the project easier to maintain and validate using standard tools.

## ðŸ’» Compatibility Checks

I used **[Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://rebekah-codes.github.io/The-Inner-Compass-Project/)**  
to verify the websiteâ€™s responsiveness and appearance across multiple devices.

### **Key Checks**
- Ensured that the layout adapted properly to mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop screens.
- Verified that all navigation and content sections displayed correctly and consistently.
- Confirmed that there were **no major layout shifts or visibility issues** across devices.

## ðŸ§© Tools, Frameworks, and External Resources

Several tools and resources were used to enhance the design and interactivity of the project:

### **Font Awesome**
- Used for accessible and scalable icons to improve visual clarity.
- Helped emphasise navigation and feature sections without increasing page load size.
https://fontawesome.com/icons
### **Bootstrap**
- Used as a **CSS framework** to simplify responsive layout creation.
- Components such as the **form** and **navigation bar** were customised for the project. Also the card was used from here.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/
- Bootstrapâ€™s **form submission structure** was used as the base to ensure semantic and accessible HTML.

### **Favicon**
- A custom favicon was implemented to enhance the siteâ€™s branding and recognition across browsers.

### **Additional Resources**
- Components and design inspiration were sourced from a variety of sites to create a cohesive, accessible interface.
- Combined multiple elements (icons, colour palettes, layout examples) to refine the final user experience.

Reflextion 

It was rather challenging, and kept me up later than expected, but overall it was a great experience that motivated me to continue and become more familiar with the process.
